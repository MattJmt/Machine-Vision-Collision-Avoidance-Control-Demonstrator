## DMT10
DMT Project on a Mechatronics Device to illustrate the concept of Control for educational purposes. 

# Overview
Device shows the benefits of electromechanical control and automation for repetitive and time critical tasks, through a collision avoidance-based arcade machine. The device is aimed at
inspiring 11–14 year-olds to consider a career in Engineering. The user’s control is increasingly automated, across the modes listed below.

# Modes of Operation

| Mode | Instruction |
|---------|---------|
|1) Fully Manual | Manipulating the joystick moves the pin left or right continuously without computer assistance|
|2) Computer Assistance | Manipulating the joystick moves the pin to one of three discrete tracks.|
|3) Computer Controlled | Fully automated machine-vision control, using the camera as input.|
